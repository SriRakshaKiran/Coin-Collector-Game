# Coin-Collector-Game
Hi, 

I created a game called Coin Collector.
The objective of this game is for the user to collect coins from start to end to finish the game.

There are a few obstacles that cause hindrances to finish the game.

Motion Controls:

Arrow Keys:

Move Forward: up arrow

Move Backward: down arrow

Move Left: left arrow

Move Right: right arrow

Jump: Space Bar

Rules of Game:

1. If the User hits an obstacle -> The game restarts
2. If the User goes out of the plot -> The game restarts

I have enhanced the game by adding sound effects.

Hope you enjoy the game!

:)
